Myself, [**Akshatha Nayak** ](https://github.com/Aksh77), [**Garima Yadav**](https://github.com/gary115),[**Sneha-Jayasankar**](https://github.com/Sneha-Jayasankar) was selected for SheHacks 2019 conducted by Gojek and Skillenza.

In the span of barely 24 hours, we developed a short project. This repository contains the NLP part of the project. 


## Citizen First | Basic Idea

Here is what CitizenFirst proposed to do:

 It scrapes/collects news articles and related media contents
daily. We then perform a variety of NLP tasks on these articles so as to understand what kind of news surrounds a minister usually, what are the developments on popular social causes etc while also serving as a regular news app â€“ thereby meeting the regular citizens every information needs. We use a variety of text processing techniques which include but are not limited to tagging, filtering, classifying, entity recognition and sentiment analysis etc

So, in short CitizenFirst scans news and popular media platforms daily: tag, sort and filter these to ensure impartiality, and gives citizens continuous curated information always. This information will be served via a web application. It builds platforms within to help citizens understand who their values are most aligned to.

This has been largely inspired from similar work done by Social analytics Companies.
